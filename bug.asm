mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]

This line of assembly code attempts to access memory at an address calculated as the sum of the value in EBX, the product of ECX and 4, and 0x10 (16 in decimal).  The problem arises if the calculation results in an address outside the allowed memory range, leading to a segmentation fault or access violation.  This is especially problematic if ECX holds a large value.
